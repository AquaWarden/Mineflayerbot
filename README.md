# Mineflayerbot

This is a repository that contains code to make java edition Minecraft Mineflayer bots. Some of the code will make it follow you, and locate a block and travel to it. It also may contain the code for my Backrooms bot in hypixel housing (coming soon.)

You will need to install things to your computer, so heres a list:

-Node.js,

-Mineflayer (using npm),

-Mineflayer, Pathfinder (also using npm).

So without further ado, lets get started!
